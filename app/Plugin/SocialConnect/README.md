### Be sure to first get and set your social network keys (API keys/secret), and change the callback URL in the config file

## Example of usage

	// Get the accessToken, or redirect if it doesn't exists in the session yet.
			$accessToken = $this->SocialConnect->get_access_token(
				$networkName,
				array( // Callback url after connecting to network, login User usually
					'controller' => 'users',
					'action' => 'login',
					strtolower($networkName)
				)
			);

			// Fetch the profile data by giving the accessToken.
			$profileData = $this->SocialConnect->get_network_profile($networkName, $accessToken);


## @TODO
*	Create easier config, perhaps even move the config to Cake itself instead of in the plugin
